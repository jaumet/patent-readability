This is especially so in the early stages of the application/examination process, as often the inventor is trying to get a patent for the broadest scope possible and thus in many cases it is not very clear as to what the applicant has invented.  Even for an experienced examiner it usually requires at least one iteration of correspondance with the Patent Attorney to better understand what the inventor has actually done that warrants a Patent.","In 2012 new legislation was passed (Raising the Bar Act 2012) in an attempt to ensure higher quality drafting of patents.  The Raising The Bar Act imposes more stringent legal tests on applicants such that the subject matter ultiamtely claimed better reflects what the applicant has actually invented and attempts to improve specifications such that the invention is better described.  

The inventive concept within Patent documents could be improved by technical experts re-writing a summary abstract which attempts to distill down the key features of the invention.
